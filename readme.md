## Description 

In this project we apply NLP pipelines to the Arabic Language and perform sentiment analysis and topic extraction on Arabic Tweets. Performing NLP on the Arabic language has its own set of difficulties due to the nature of the language like detecting stopwords and reconciling the multiple dialects. 

## Goal

The ultimate goal is to be able to gain insights from political Tweets in Arabic countries and compare those insights to financial or economical indicators (market, currency) to see if we could have partially predicted a historical crisis like the Arab Spring.

## Datasets 

- Translation of tweets in https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140 to arabic using Google Translate API.
